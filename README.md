# Java and DSA Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This space is where I document my progress as I learn 'Java' from the basics to advanced concepts and dive into 'Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)'. Iâ€™m following several resources, including YouTube series by 'Kunal Kushwaha (#DSAwithKunal)' and 'Engineering Animuthyam'. 

This journey is part of my 60-day challenge, where I'll consistently learn, practice, and post updates as I build my skills in Java and DSA. I'll be progressing through concepts such as OOP, collections, recursion, sorting algorithms, and more!

# Learning Plan
- Java Basics: Syntax, loops, functions, and OOP concepts.
- Advanced Java: Collections, exceptions, and streams.
- DSA: Arrays, linked lists, recursion, sorting, and searching algorithms.

# Progress
I will update this repo regularly with:
- Code solutions.
- Concepts learned.
- Weekly reflections.
